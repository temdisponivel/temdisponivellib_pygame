Framework on top of Pygame for game development using scenes, game objects, components, and more.

The principal idea is to make game objects that can have multiples components attached to, 
so that they can be updated and draw whitin the lifecyle of the game object.

Some components are ready, like two typed of colliders (just temporary, because hopefully i`ll integrate Box2D soon),
a sprite renderer, camera and transform. All very basic yet.

There no good release yet. In development.

Wanna help? Just let me know.
